 * harder when `n` is small. Used to keep card stats from a tiny archetype
 * from looking as confidently good as the same stats from a large one.
 *
 * Formally this is the Wilson score interval lower bound for a binomial
 * proportion at confidence level `z` (default z=1.96 ≈ 95%). In this
 * pipeline the inputs are recency-weighted (and therefore non-integer)
 * game counts, so `n` is treated as an effective sample size rather than
 * a strict binomial trial count, and the result should be read as a
 * sample-size-aware shrinkage rather than a true CI bound. Returns 0 if
 * `n` <= 0.
